# Backups

## Enterprise cloud

Your Enterprise cloud data is backed up continuously and retained for 30 days. Within those 30 days we can restore your data to any point in time with a precision of 5 minutes, in case you need us to.

*Note: At the moment it is only possible to restore the complete instance into a former state. All future edits after the former state will be not available in the restored instance. In order to offer you the possibility of recreating the restored information to your productive instance, the restored version is temporarily available on a separate URL. You will have all the time you need to clone the lost information from the temporary instance to the production one. This could be done by using e.g. API calls or manual interaction.*   

## Backup via GUI

**Please navigate to the [System admin guide Backup page](../../../system-admin-guide/backup/)**
